# Brainscan an experiment with AI and EEG 
By Gabriel Fergesen



# WARNING: this is a WORK IN PROGRESS
more code and everything will come soon


The goal of Brainscan: an experiment with AI and EEG is to teach a AI what boredom is via custom data software for recording
data from two types of biosensors: HR (on the finger) and EEG. Currently development of testing software to stimulate boredom is under
development.


If you've come all this way for a wip, or want to get this project going faster, go work in issues! 
There are so many issues and files, but if we keep working, this project will be done soon.

So, what are you waiting for? Go to the wiki to see the code flowcharts and get working!!
